## Description
The files in the Source folder are C based codes prepared for ARM Embedded-style Processors. The algorithm performs image processing by reducing the size of the RGB images seen and converting them to gray-scale (Black&White). With Code Composer Studio, PIN addresses can be routed and used for Path Tracker tasks in the automotive industry.
